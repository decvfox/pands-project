# Introduction
Fisher’s Iris Data Set is based on data collected by Edgar Anderson from three species of irises in the Gaspé Peninsula in Quebec, Canada. This Data set has been used countless times in statistics papers since they were first used by R. A. Fisher in 1936 to introduce the method of discriminant analysis. The dataset is made up of five variables, the first four of which are measurements of Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length and Petal Width, and a fifth variable which denotes which species of iris, Iris Setosa,Iris Versicolour, and Iris Virginca(Fox and Weisberg, 2011). There are 50 samples for each species for a total of 150 samples. Fishers aim was to classify the species based on the different measurements in the dataset and since the advent of machine learning this dataset has become a benchmark for testing algorithms.
#### Sepals
In most flowering plants sepals are usually the green leaf like structures that enclose the flower in the bud and open up to support the petals when it blooms. While Botanists disagree as to whether Irises have Sepals or not(‘What-should-we-know-about-the-famous-Iris-data.pdf’, 2013), for the purposes of this project, we will, as Anderson and Fisher have done, count the larger petal-like parts of the flower as sepals.

### Dataset Collection
I will demonstrate three common ways of getting data for analysis:
(i)	Manually download the data set and store it as a CSV file on a local drive.
(ii)	Using an API, many organizations provide an interface to make it easier for developers to interface with their data, https://scikit-learn.org/ provide datasets that can be used in data analytics through their API which I used to download the Iris dataset. 
(iii)	Scraping  the data from a website, this can also be used by organizations to gather data from internal reports generated by apps in html. To demonstrate this, I scraped the dataset from Wikipedia.

### Dataset Comparison
I used the Pandas compare method to compare the 3 datasets
```python
print('CSV vs API\n', df1.compare(df2))
print('\nCSV vs WIKI\n', df1.compare(df3))
print('\nAPI vs WIKI\n', df2.compare(df3))
```
and got the following results
```
CSV vs API
    sepal width (cm)       petal length (cm)       petal width (cm)      
               self other              self other             self other 
34              NaN   NaN               NaN   NaN              0.1   0.2 
37              3.1   3.6               1.5   1.4              NaN   NaN 

CSV vs WIKI
    sepal width (cm)       petal length (cm)       petal width (cm)      
               self other              self other             self other 
4               NaN   NaN               NaN   NaN              0.2   0.3 
34              NaN   NaN               NaN   NaN              0.1   0.2 
37              3.1   3.6               1.5   1.4              NaN   NaN

API vs WIKI
   petal width (cm)      
              self other
4              0.2   0.3
```
I would have expected Wikipedia to have a mistake or two, but I would have expected the CSV version and the SK-learn API version to match as both are used for teaching Data Analytics and Machine Learning. I looked up fisher's original paper(Fisher, R.A., 1936.) and found that the API version is the correct one. I will use this version for all my work going forward.

### Datset Storage
I will store the datasets in 3 worksheets in the same Excel Workbook

### preparation



### explore plot etc.



### experiment predict
