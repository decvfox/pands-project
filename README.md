# Introduction
Fisher’s Iris Data Set is based on data collected by Edgar Anderson from three species of irises in the Gaspé Peninsula in Quebec, Canada. This Data set has been used countless times in statistics papers since they were first used by R. A. Fisher in 1936 to introduce the method of discriminant analysis. The dataset is made up of five variables, the first four of which are measurements of Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length and Petal Width, and a fifth variable which denotes which species of iris. (Fox and Weisberg, 2011) 
## Sepals
In most flowering plants sepals are usually the green leaf like structures that enclose the flower in the bud and open up to support the petals when it blooms. While Botanists disagree as to whether Irises have Sepals or not(‘What-should-we-know-about-the-famous-Iris-data.pdf’, 2013), for the purposes of this project, we will, as Anderson and Fisher have done, count the larger petal-like parts of the flower as sepals.
