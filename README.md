# Introduction
Fisher’s Iris Data Set is based on data collected by Edgar Anderson from three species of irises in the Gaspé Peninsula in Quebec, Canada. This Data set has been used countless times in statistics papers since they were first used by R. A. Fisher in 1936 to introduce the method of discriminant analysis. The dataset is made up of five variables, the first four of which are measurements of Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length and Petal Width, and a fifth variable which denotes which species of iris, Iris Setosa,Iris Versicolour, and Iris Virginca(Fox and Weisberg, 2011). There are 50 samples for each species for a total of 150 samples. Fishers aim was to classify the species based on the different measurements in the dataset and since the advent of machine learning this dataset has become a benchmark for testing algorithms.
#### Sepals
In most flowering plants sepals are usually the green leaf like structures that enclose the flower in the bud and open up to support the petals when it blooms. While Botanists disagree as to whether Irises have Sepals or not(‘What-should-we-know-about-the-famous-Iris-data.pdf’, 2013), for the purposes of this project, we will, as Anderson and Fisher have done, count the larger petal-like parts of the flower as sepals.

### Set-up

### Dataset Collection
I will demonstrate three common ways of getting data for analysis:
(i)	Manually download the data set and store it as a CSV file on a local drive.
(ii)	Using an API, many organizations provide an interface to make it easier for developers to interface with their data, https://scikit-learn.org/ provide datasets that can be used in data analytics through their API which I used to download the Iris dataset. 
(iii)	Scraping  the data from a website, this can also be used by organizations to gather data from internal reports generated by apps in html. To demonstrate this, I scraped the dataset from Wikipedia.

### preparation
I will add headings, add or remove columns so I can save the datasets in the same format, this will also make the datasets easier to compare.

### Dataset Comparison
I used the Pandas compare method to compare the 3 datasets. I used Wikipedia as one of my sources in the hopes that it wouldn't be as correct as the other two datasets but instead I found more issues with ACI version.

### Datset Storage
I will store the datasets in 3 worksheets in the same Excel Workbook

### explore plot etc.
I will use matplotlib and seaborn to creat plots that will make the data easier to visualise and understand.

### experiment predict
I have decided to see if I could create a method for classifying the samples myself rather than importing and using a library I might not fully understand.

### Conclusion
I found this project remarkably interesting, particularly using pandas to store and manipulate data. I also enjoyed using Matplotlib and Seaborn to plot the data. I would have liked to have had a larger dataset to use these tools to their full potential.
